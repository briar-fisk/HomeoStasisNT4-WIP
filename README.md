# Gaia Module with NT4 NeuralNet Engine

## Overview

The Gaia Module is an intelligent system designed for maintaining homeostasis within an arcology. Developed using the Quanta Based Hierarchically Organized Distributed Symbol Network (DSM) architecture, the Gaia Module leverages the power of the NT4 NeuralNet Engine for efficient processing and decision-making.

### Quanta Based Hierarchically Organized DSM Architecture

The DSM architecture is a symbolic neural network that deviates from traditional connectivist numerical neural networks. It is inspired by the hierarchical organization of the mind in handling symbolic reasoning. Key components include Treetop Nodes representing complete encoded symbols, State Nodes holding the smallest sub-symbols, and a Current-Active-Node Scaffold facilitating transparent manipulation of encoded traces.

### NT4 NeuralNet Engine

The Gaia Module relies on the NT4 NeuralNet Engine as its core machine learning engine. The NT4 engine is designed to implement the DSM architecture efficiently, providing the necessary tools for encoding and decoding patterns losslessly. The engine's deterministic hierarchical connections enable the representation of distributed symbols, allowing the Gaia Module to learn from past experiences and make informed decisions.

## Functionality

### Initialization and Setup

1. **Awakening:**
   - Gaia starts with no connected I/O, short-term memory, or goal states set.
  
2. **I/O Registration:**
   - Sensors and actuators are registered, connecting Gaia to the arcology's environment.

3. **Goal State Definition:**
   - Optimal states for inputs (Homeostasis_Set) are defined, guiding Gaia in maintaining balance.

4. **Memory Initialization:**
   - Short-term memory is set up, determining the duration for retaining recent events.

### Operation Loop

1. **Input Reception - Sensory Perception:**
   - Gaia receives information from sensors, analogous to human senses.

2. **Time Series Storage - Memory:**
   - Extensive memory stores experiences and observations over time, akin to human memory.

3. **Granulation & Categorization:**
   - Data complexity is reduced by categorizing information into larger granules, simplifying dataset processing.

4. **Delta Direction Calculation:**
   - Gaia calculates the direction of change by comparing current observations to the most recent ones.

5. **Incrementing Data:**
   - Short-term memory is updated by bumping off the oldest observation, making room for the latest one.

6. **Symbolic & Temporal ML Analysis:**
   - Gaia analyzes past observations to make educated predictions about the current situation (Current_Prediction).

7. **Deviation Recognition:**
   - Deviations from optimal states are recognized by comparing Current_Prediction to Homeostasis_Set.

8. **Memory Search:**
   - Gaia searches its photographic memory for similar situations before identified deviations.

9. **Selection of Suitable Traces:**
   - Gaia selects traces from memory based on their effectiveness in similar situations, creating sets for working forwards and backwards.

10. **Actuator Output Synthesis:**
    - Gaia synthesizes outputs for actuators by evaluating memories and determining appropriate actions.

11. **Iterative Process:**
    - The entire process is iterative, allowing Gaia to continuously adapt to changing conditions within the arcology.

### Evolutionary Design

- The emergence of short-term memory was an unplanned feature that evolved during the design process, showcasing the system's adaptability and responsiveness to functional requirements.

## Usage

When the wrapper around the module is far enough this section will be filled out. Right now it is still a WIP on internal systems.
